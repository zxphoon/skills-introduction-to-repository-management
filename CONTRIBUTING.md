# Contributing to the Mergington High Extra-Curricular Activities Website

Thank you for your interest in helping improve our school's website!
Whether you want to add your club's activities, fix a bug, or suggest
new features, this guide will help you get started. ðŸŽ‰

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Install Python requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the development server: `python src/app.py`.
4. Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser to see the website.

## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes.
   - Use descriptive names like `art-gallery-feature` or `fix-chess-signup`
2. Make your changes and test them locally with sample student data.
   - Use the MongoDB extension to preview the included sample date.
3. Push your branch and create a pull request.
4. Wait for review and address any feedback.

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code (backend).
- Use clear, descriptive variable names (student_name, start_time, etc.)
- Add comments to describe blocks of logic.

## Need help or have ideas?

- Check the open issues first.
  - If your problem is there, add a comment or up-vote.
  - If not there, create a new issue. Be as descriptive as possible.
- Ask in our weekly IT Club office hours (Thursdays at lunch in Room 203).
- For other general problems, email the tech team at techclub@mergingtonhigh.example.edu
